This was a semester long group project for one of my college classes. It is a website for a fictitious Tool rental warehouse
company.  The website was built using HTML and javascript, and we used the framework Spring to host our webiste. The webiste isnt
online. 

Steps to view webiste:
1. clone/download repository
2. In a command line interface navigate to the spring folder. [C:\...\cs3450_Tool_Rental_Warehouse_Website\spring]
3. While in the spring folder tpye "./mvnw spring-boot:run" to start spring. (The spring framework will download if spring isnt on
on the computer) Spring will host the website.
4.open a web browser and enter "localhost:8080" to access the website

# Phase 1

### Organization and Naming Scheme
* Docs
    * Word Documents
        * UpperCamelCase
* Src
    * Projoct Folders
        * ProjectName-v.1.0
            * comments at the top explaining whats been changed with your name

### Version Control Procedures
* All use the same version of the language (ie. JDK 11)
* Use the naming scheme

### Tool stack description and setup procedure
* Description
    * Using Spring, based on java, to manage the database. 
    * HTML and CSS to build the pages
    * Java for functionality
    * IntelliJ
* Setup
    * Placed in the git repository so everyone can access it

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/ChrisWin22/SoftwareEngineering.git
2. Make sure the repository has the following:
    * docs
    * Spring
    * .gitignore
    * tool-inventory.csv
3. Install the Java, IntelliJ and JDK 11.

### Unit Testing instructions
* Did the function I just wrote work?
* Test the code as you're building it.
    * This can take longer but avoids having to go back after coding to find errors.

### System Testing instructions
* Test the program on multiple computers to make sure different computers can handle it
* Make sure all the programs work together as a whole.

### Other Notes
* Ask "is there a way this code can be cleaned up"
* Look for simple fixes to keep the naming scheme of the programs consistent
